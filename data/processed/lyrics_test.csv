1,1,"Pearls and swine.
Bereft of me.
Long and weary.
My road has been.
I was lost in the cities.
Alone in the hills.
No sorrow or pity.
For leaving, I feel, yeah.
I am not your rolling wheels.
I am the highway.
I am not your carpet ride.
I am the sky.
Friends and liars.
Don't wait for me.
Cause I'll get on.
All by myself.
I put millions of miles.
Under my heels.
And still too close.
To you, I feel, yeah.
I am not your rolling wheels.
I am the highway.
I am not your carpet ride.
I am the sky.
I am not your blowing wind.
I am the lightning.
I am not your autumn moon.
I am the night, the night.
Yeah! I am not your rolling wheels.
I am the highway.
I am not your carpet ride.
I am the sky.
Well, I am not your blowing wind.
I am the lightning.
I am not your autumn moon.
I am the night, the night.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
"
2,2,"And with the early dawn moving right along.
I couldn't buy an eyeful of sleep.
And in the aching night under satellites.
I was not received.
Built with stolen parts, a telephone in my heart.
Someone get me a priest.
To put my mind to bed, this ringing in my head.
Is this a cure or is this a disease?
Nail in my head from my creator.
You gave me life, now show me how to live.
Nail in my head from my creator.
You gave me life, now show me how to live.
And in the after birth on the quiet earth.
Let the stains remind you.
You thought you made a man, you better think again.
Before my role defines you.
Nail in my head from my creator.
You gave me life, now show me how to live.
Nail in my head from my creator.
You gave me life, now show me how to live.
And in your waiting hands, I will land.
And roll out of my skin.
And in your final hours, I will stand.
Ready to begin.
Ready to begin.
Ready to begin.
Ready to begin.
Nail in my head from my creator.
You gave me life, now show me how to live.
Nail in my head from my creator.
You gave me life, now show me how to live.
Show me how to live.
Show me how to live.
Show me how to live.
Show me how to live.

3,3,"Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone.
Someone kills the pain, spinning in the silence.
She finally drifts away.
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard, catches a bouquet.
Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave.
Yeah, and to be yourself is all that you can do.
Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do.
Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain.
Someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays.
Someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away.
Separate or united, healthy or insane.
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh.
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh.
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh.
To be yourself is all that you can do.
And even when you've paid enough.
Been pulled apart or been held up.
Every single memory of the good or bad.
Faces of luck, don't lose any sleep tonight.
I'm sure everything will end up alright.
You may win or lose.
But to be yourself is all that you can do, yeah.
To be yourself is all that you can do, oh.
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh.
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh-yeah.
To be yourself is all that you can.
Be yourself is all that you can.
Be yourself is all that you can do.
"
4,4,"Well, I've been watching, while you've been coughing.
I've been drinking life, while you've been nauseous.
And so I drink to health, while you kill yourself.
And I've got just one thing that I can offer.
Go on and save yourself.
And take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself.
And take it out on me, yeah.
I'm not a martyr, I'm not a prophet.
And I won't preach to you, but here's a caution.
You better understand, that I won't hold your hand.
But if it helps you mend, then I won't stop it.
Go on and save yourself.
And take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself.
And take it out on me, yeah.
Go on and save yourself.
And take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself.
And take it out on me, yeah.
Drown if you want, and I'll see you at the bottom.
Where you'll crawl on my skin and put the blame on me.
So you don't feel a thing.
Go on and save yourself.
And take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself.
And take it out on me, yeah.
Go on and save yourself.
And take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself.
And take it out on me, yeah.

5,5,"I walk the streets of Japan 'til I get lost.
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything.
With a graveyard tan carrying a cross.
Yeah, it doesn't remind me of anything.
I like studying faces in parking lot.
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything.
I like drivin' backwards in the fog.
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything.
The things that I've loved, things that I've lost.
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped.
I won't lie no more you can bet.
I don't wanna learn what I'll need to forget.
I like gypsy moths and radio talk.
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything.
I like gospel music and canned applause.
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything.
I like colorful clothing in the sun.
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything.
I like hammering nails and speaking in tongues.
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything.
The things that I've loved, things that I've lost.
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped.
I won't lie no more you can bet.
Don't wanna learn what I'll need....
Bend and shape me, I love the way you are.
Slow and sweetly like never before.
Calm and sleeping, we won't stir up the past.
So discreetly we won't look back.
The things that I've loved, things that I've lost.
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped.
I won't lie no more you can bet.
I don't wanna learn what I'll need.
I like throwing my voice and breaking guitars.
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything.
I like playin' in the sand, what's mine is ours.
If it doesn't remind me of anything.
"
6,6,"Once upon a time.
I was of the mind.
To lay your burden down.
And leave you where you stood.
You believed I could.
You'd seen it done before.
I could read your thoughts.
And tell you what you saw.
And never say a word.
But now all that is gone.
Over with and done.
Never to return.
And I can tell you why.
People die alone.
I can tell you I'm.
A shadow on the sun.
Staring at the loss.
Looking for the cause.
And never really sure.
Nothing but a hole.
To live without a soul.
And nothing to be learned.
And I can tell you why.
People go insane.
I can show you how.
You could do the same.
I can tell you why.
The end will never come.
I can tell you I'm.
A shadow on the sun.
Shapes of every size.
Move behind my eyes.
Doors inside my head.
Bolted from within.
Every drop of flame.
Lights a candle in.
Memory of the one.
Who lived inside my skin.
And I can tell you why.
People go insane.
I can show you how.
You could do the same.
I can tell you why.
The end will never come.
I can tell you I'm.
The shadow on the sun.
Shadow on the sun.
Shadow on the sun.
Shadow on the sun.
Shadow on the sun.
Shadow on the sun.
Shadow on the sun.
Shadow on the sun.
Shadow on the sun.
Sun, sun.
"
7,7,"The first time I saw you.
You were chasing down.
A cyclone.
All alone in a field.
With rail yards and clovers.
I kept rolling on and never thought.
You'd wind up chasing me.
Settle down, I won't hesitate.
To hit the highway.
Before you lay me to waste.
Saddle up and I'll help you find.
Something to drive.
Before you drive me insane.
You're tired of walking and you.
Loathe the ground.
The sidewalk will barely touch your feet.
And life moves too slowly to hold you down.
With wringing hands.
You take it out on me.
Settle down, I won't hesitate.
To hit the highway.
Before you lay me to waste.
Saddle up and I'll help you find.
Something to drive.
Before you drive me insane.
So get yourself a car.
And drive it all alone.
Get yourself a car.
And ride it on the wind.
Get yourself a car.
And drive it all alone.
Get yourself a car.
And ride it on the wind.
Settle down, I won't hesitate.
To hit the highway.
Before you lay me to waste.
Saddle up and I'll help you find.
Something to drive.
Before you drive me insane.
So get yourself a car.
And drive it all alone.
Get yourself a car.
And ride it on the wind.
"
8,8,"And when you wanted me, I came to you.
And when you wanted someone else, I withdrew.
And when you asked for light, I set myself on fire.
And if I go far away, I know.
You'll find another slave.
Now I'm free from what you want.
Now I'm free from what you need.
Now I'm free from what you are.
And when you wanted blood, I cut my veins.
And when you wanted love, I bled myself again.
Now that I've had my fill of you, I'll give you up forever.
And here I go, far away, I know you.
You'll find another slave.
Now I'm free from what you want.
Now I'm free from what you need.
Now I'm free from what you are.
Then a vision came to me.
When you came along.
I gave you everything.
But then you wanted more.
Now I'm free from what you want.
Now I'm free from what you need.
Now I'm free from what you are.
Hey, now I'm free from what you want.
Now I'm free from what you need.
Now I'm free from what you are.
"
9,9,"House is haunted.
I just want to go for a ride.
Out and on.
Before I set this room alight.
Left alone.
Forever, and for crimes unclear.
With my patience gone.
Someone take me far from here.
Yeah, burning that gasoline.
Yeah, burning that gasoline.
New day yawning.
Another day of solitaire.
House is honest.
Clearly more than I can bear.
Drag me off.
Before I set my world on fire.
Out and gone.
The sun will never set tonight.
Yeah, burning that gasoline.
Yeah, burning that gasoline.
No ""What fors"".
Only a can of red.
It says danger on it.
I have found another way.
Burning that gasoline.
Yeah, burning that gasoline.
Burning it all the way.
Burning it all the way.
"
10,11,"Roll me on your frozen fields.
Break my bones to watch them heal.
Drowned me in your thirsty veins.
Where I'll watch and I'll wait.
And pray for the rain.
Curl like smoke and breathe again.
Down your throat, inside your ribs.
Through your spine, and every nerve.
Where I watch and I wait.
And yield to the hurt.
And if you don't believe the sun will rise.
Stand alone and greet the coming night.
In the last remaining light.
The seven moons and the seven suns.
Heaven waits for those who run.
Down your winter and underneath your waves.
Where you watch and you wait.
And pray for the day.
And if you don't believe the sun will rise.
Stand alone and greet the coming night.
In the last remaining light.
And if you don't believe the sun will rise.
Stand alone and greet the coming night.
In the last remaining light.
Light.
Light.
Light.

11,12,"He was standing at the rock, gathering the flock.
And getting there with no directions.
And underneath the arch it turned into a march.
And there he found the spark to set this fucker off.
Set it off, set it off now children, set it right.
Set it off, set it off now children, alright.
Set it off, set it off now children, set a fire.
Set it off, set it off now children.
Suddenly a shot ripped into his heart.
And he lay in need of some attention.
And there he played his card, going into shock.
The last thing that he said was, set this fucker off.
Set it off, set it off now children, set it right.
Set it off, set it off now children, alright.
Set it off, set it off now children, set a fire.
Set it off, set it off now children.
Alright, alright, alright.
Alright, alright, alright.
Jesus at the back door, everything is all right.
All we need is some direction.
Every time the wind blows.
Everything you don't know turns into a revelation.
And it all adds up inside your head.
Time is wasting.
Set it off, set it off now children, set it right.
Set it off, set it off now children, alright.
Set it off, set it off now children, set a fire.
Set it off, set it off now children.
Alright, alright, alright.
Alright, alright, alright.
"
12,13,"You know what to do, you know what I did.
Since you know everything, just clue me in.
I am such a wreck, I am such a mess.
I know what I know, why don't you fill in the rest?
I will bring it down, I will make it bad.
While you're feeling proud, why don't you help me?
Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now.
Your revelations.
Cut me in, I don't want to live without.
Your revelations, revelations.
You know what to say, you know what I said.
You know what I dream sleeping in my bed.
You hold all the keys, you know all the roads.
Why don't you guide me in if I'm such a lost soul?
I'll spin it 'round, I will make you ill.
Since I'm so broken down, why don't you fix me?
Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now.
(I wouldn't know by now).
Your revelations.
Cut me in, I don't want to live without.
(Don't want to live without).
Your revelations.
I am haunted when I am sleeping.
Try to give without receiving.
It's in the apple bite (It's in the apple bite).
It's in the days and nights (It's in the days and nights).
In the afterlife we'll meet.
Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now.
(I wouldn't know by now).
Your revelations.
Cut me in, I don't want to live without.
(Don't want to live without).
Your revelations.
Such a shame, such a shame.
That I wouldn't know by now.
Cut me in, I don't want to live without.

13,14,"In my hour of need.
On a sea of grey.
On my knees I pray to you.
Help me find the dawn.
Of the dying day.
Won't you light my way.
Won't you light my way.
Won't you light my way.
Won't you light my way.
A bullet is a man.
From time to time he strays.
I compare my life to this.
To this I relate.
And I'm willing.
To listen to your answers.
And I'm not afraid.
To tell you I need you today.
Won't you light my way.
Won't you light my way.
Won't you light my way.
Won't you light my way.
So when I'm lost.
Or I'm tired and depraved.
Or when my high bullet mind.
Goes astray.
Won't you light my way.
Don't save it for another day.
Don't save it for another day.
Don't save it for another day.
Don't save it for another day.
Won't you light my way.
Won't you light my way.
Won't you light my way.
Won't you light my way.

14,15,"Anchor the night, open the sky.
Hide in the hours before sunrise.
Pray for me not, I won't lose sight.
Of where I belong and where you lie.
Well, Heaven's dead when you get sad.
I see wishes fly.
Out of time.
For the best time you've had.
Shipwreck the sun, well, I'm on your side.
An army of one, onward we will ride.
Whisper your songs, birds to the air.
We'll bury all of our burdens there.
Well, Heaven's dead when you get sad.
I see wishes fly.
Out of time.
For the best time you've had.
Heaven's dead when you get sad.
I see wishes fly.
Out of time.
For the best time you've had.
For the best time you had.
Best time you had.
Heaven's dead when you get sad.
Well, Heaven's dead when you get sad.
I see wishes fly.
Out of time.
For the best time you've had.
Heaven's dead when you get sad.
I see wishes fly.
Out of time.

I'll take it all, arrows or guns.
Hundreds more to save you from one.
To save you from one.
To save you from one.
To save you from one.
Heaven's dead when you get sad.

15,16,"When I first came to this island.
That I called by my own name.
I was happy in this fortress.
In my exile I remained.
But the hours grew so empty.
And the ocean sent her waves.
In the figure of a woman.
She pulled me out to sea.
When you come down to take me home.
Send my soul away.
When you come 'round you'll make me whole.
Send my soul away.
On the altar of a sunrise.
Was a wedding in the waves.
And inside her shone a young light.
From her labor I was saved.
Though I've traveled long in darkness.
In her harvest I'm embraced.
When you come down to take me home.
Send my soul away.
When you come 'round you'll make me whole.
Send my soul away.
Now the spires and the gables.
Grow in orchards to the sky.
And the blessings on my table.
Multiply and divide.
When you come down to take me home.
Send my soul away.
When you come 'round you'll make me whole.
Send my soul away.
Yeah, when you come down to take me home.
When you come 'round you'll make me whole.
Yeah, when you come down to take me home.
Send my soul away.
Send my soul away.
Send my soul away.
Send my soul away.

16,17,"You can look a hurricane right in the eye.
1200 people dead or left to die.
Follow the leaders, were it an eye for an eye.
We'll all be blind, deaf or murdered, this I'm sure.
In this uncertain time.
So come and pull the sheet over my eyes.
So I can sleep tonight despite what I've seen today.
I find you guilty of the crime of sleeping at a time.
When you should have been wide awake.
Down on the road the world is floating by.
The poor and undefended left behind.
While you're somewhere trading lives for oil.
As if the whole world were blind, hey.
So come and pull the sheet over my eyes.
So I can sleep tonight despite what I've seen today.
I find you guilty of the crime of sleeping at a time.
When you should have been wide awake.
So come and pull the sheet over my eyes.
So I can sleep tonight despite what I've seen today.
I find you guilty of the crime of sleeping at a time.
When you should have been wide awake.
Wide awake.

17,18,"Now one fell asleep in the street and he never woke up.
Now one died in pieces in his bed with the mouth full of gold.
And one threatened me long ago when I saw him.
Melt in the bright light of day.
And one laid to rest in a field under starlings and crows, hey.
I've been wandering sideways.
I've stared straight into the sun.
Still, I don't know why you're dying.
Long before your time has come.
Your time has come.
Now one took some bullets in the chest in a deal gone wrong.
One got a little too depressed and he went and jumped the gun.
One got shot right in the face and he somehow survived.
But he doesn't know my name or who I am.
And I'm not surprised, hey.
I've been wandering sideways.
I've stared straight into the sun.
Still, I don't know why you're dying.
Long before your time has come.
I've been wandering sideways.
And I've stared straight into the sun.
Still, I don't know why you're dying.
Long before your time has come.
Your time has come, yeah.
I've seen 50,000 names all engraved on a stone.
Most of them, met an early grave.
Years before I was born.
All of them left brothers and sisters and mothers behind.
And most of their family and friends alive, doing time.
I've been wandering sideways.
I've stared straight into the sun.
Still, I don't know why you're dying.
Long before your time has come.
I've been wandering sideways.
I've stared straight into the sun.
Still, I don't know why you're dying.
Long before your time has come.
Long before your time has come.
Long before your time has come.
And your time has come.
"
18,19,"Listen now and let me speak.
I will be the dog at your feet.
Come along when you call.
Be the little bird in your straw.
And sing you a song.
I'll be there to take the fall.
Though you tread upon me.
For no reason at all.
But just when you think you've left me blind.
Well, I'll need to.
Yeah, I will keep you in the corner of my eye.
The corner of my eye.
I will never leave your side.
Though you call me your number one zero.
You never mind, I'll be your king, I'll be your pawn.
I will build a pedestal and put you upon it, baby.
Just when you think you've left me blind.
I will be creeping right up behind.
Because maybe if I need to, yeah.
I will keep you in the corner of my eye.
Down on the street, over your night.
Out of your sleep, out of your sight.
If I need to, yeah, if I need to.
Out of your mouth in every word.
Down in your ego one thing is sure.
I will keep you, I will keep you.
Just when you think you've left me blind.
I will be creeping right up behind.
Because maybe if I need to, yeah.
I will keep you in the corner of my eye.
Corner of my eye.
I will be the bird in your straw.
But you won't get far.
I will keep you in the corner of my eye.
"
19,20,"I was on my way to the center of the sun.
When I lost my wings and I fell into a crowd.
And they carried me to a hole in the ground.
And they buried me, where no one could see.
And no one would be around.
I am a virus.
I live in silence.
I was on my way to a city in the clouds.
When I lost my mind and I had to settle down.
Then I had a dream of an island in the sea where the lepers die.
Where no one survives and no one can hear the cries.
I am a virus.
I live in silence.
Just like heathens thinking.
On our feet we'll believe in God.
With one step, two steps, three steps toward the graveyard.
On the high road to remembering.
It seems that we forgot.
I am a virus.
I live in silence.
"
20,21,"Settle down now and sit with me.
Let me tell you how this all came to be.
A yellow flower with your petals to the air.
And flying on paper wings that brought you here.
Summer rolls on in the lazy hours.
An neither dream way of hummingbirds and clouds.
Midnight swims in the cool black waves.
And you in my arms as it rolls away.
Little dandelion.
Let your heart keep time.
Now the clouds are gone.
All your tomorrows shine.
Oh, oh.
All your tomorrows shine.
Oh, oh.
All your tomorrows shine.
Born of restless night the moon as a pearl.
Playing games down inside your soft warm world.
Hear my voice, I know that you can.
You're the fire in my eyes, the sun as a man.
Seasons come along and seasons go.
And what they'll leave behind, I don't pretend to know.
I'm afraid that all I have missed.
Will loom very large when the darkness lifts.
Little dandelion.
Let your heart keep time.
Now the clouds are gone.
All your tomorrows shine.
Oh, oh.
All your tomorrows shine.
Oh, oh.
All your tomorrows.
I will ride by your side.
Wherever you go.
I won't run, I won't hide.
Just letting you know.
Just letting you know.
Little dandelion.
Let your heart keep time.
Now the clouds are gone.
All your tomorrows shine.
Oh, oh.
All your tomorrows shine.
Oh, oh.
All your tomorrows shine.
Oh, oh.
All your tomorrows shine.
"
21,22,"Well, it's late in the hour.
And a few more grains of sand will fall.
On the colorful flowers.
Grown upon the dust and moss.
Now I feel the worst is near.
I hold them close and count their years.
Pray, a ray of light appears.
To shine down on us here.
Break down in the shape of things to come.
But I'm moving on like a soldier.
And I say now when all is said and done.
It's not ours to break the shape of things to come.
There's a crack in the clouds.
But only for a moment now.
Like an eye looking out.
In the blue skies finds the roads, we will go down.
I wonder what they hold for us.
I hold my family to my breast.
I fear the worst and hope the best.
Will come to see us blessed.
Break down in the shape of things to come.
But I'm moving on like a soldier.
And I say now when all is said and done.
It's not ours to break the shape of things to come.
Given one more try, wonder what I'd change?
I won't deny, the thought is strange.
I've done my best and I will lay no blame myself.
Break down in the shape of things to come.
But I'm moving on like a soldier.
And I say now when all is said and done.
It's not ours to break the shape of things to come.
The shape of things to come.
The shape of things to come.
"
22,23,"Help me I don't know what I'm doing.
Help me before I fall to ruin.
And if I'm blind, I will lead you on.
Come follow me now before our time is gone.
And as you're laughing at this fool tonight.
Let me rid myself of any line that I might choose to trip you up.
And as I'm howling at the moonlight, don't you kid yourself.
I will be your luck and never be your curse, never be your curse.
Help me I don't know what I'm saying.
Sometimes this tongue can be betraying.
And if I'm wrong, is that such a crime?
And if you want, you can set my words to right.
And as you're laughing at this fool tonight.
Let me rid myself of any line that I might choose to trip you up.
And as I'm howling at the moonlight, don't you kid yourself.
I will be your luck and never be your curse, never be your curse.
And if your eyes forget to well.
And if your lies forget to tell.
And if our paths forget to cross.
It doesn't mean you're lost.
And as you're laughing at this fool tonight.
Let me rid myself of any line that I might choose to trip you up.
And as I'm howling at the moonlight, don't you kid yourself.
I will be your luck and never be your curse, never be your curse.
And as you're laughing at this fool tonight.
Let me rid myself of any line that I might choose to trip you up.
And as I'm howling at the moonlight, don't you kid yourself.
I will be your luck and never be your curse, never be your curse.
"
23,24,"Beauty is what eyes behold.
And you burn brighter than most.
I chased you through the midnight streets.
To be where I could speak freely.
I didn't care what tomorrow held.
I felt the world turning only for us.
Only bliss now for you and me.
Rise up let life's kiss send us reeling.
And unlike the times before.
From yesterday comes tomorrow.
When life comes alive, the past moves aside.
No regrets and no remorse.
Come on, come on, come on.
We have more than everything.
More than man or machine.
More than luck, more than fiction.
Higher than any religion.
And unlike the times before.
From yesterday comes tomorrow.
When life comes alive, the past moves aside.
No regrets and no remorse.
Come on, come on, come on.
We'll squeeze the blood out of life.
And say goodnight to the silver of old.
And even when wrong, we're right.
Far beyond the world of diamonds and gold.
I've come to realize.
Where happiness lies.
I want you to know, I know.
Come on, come on, come on.
And unlike the times before.
From yesterday comes tomorrow.
When life comes alive, the past moves aside.
No regrets and no remorse.
Come on, come on, come on.

24,25,"Well if you set your mind upon it, I know that you can.
You've got everything you wanted.
You've done everything you planned.
So let me make an offer.
I'm only trying to help.
You can make your load just a little lighter.
All you got to do is share the wealth.
Oh no don't you keep your.
Good luck to yourself.
Oh no don't you keep your.
Good luck to yourself.
Well I know you've got problems.
I see it in your eyes.
But if you want to live to see the morning.
Give it up to your brother.

25,26,"Thought I was different, it seems I'm just the same.
As again I put my hand over the flame.
I thought, I was smarter as I flew into the sun.
But it turned out the way it does with everyone.
Oh, oh.
I don't fly around your fire anymore.
I don't fly around your fire anymore.
Burned and fallen down so many times before.
I don't fly around your fire anymore.
I loved the heat, I loved the things that I forgot.
I loved the strings that tied me down and cut me off.
I was a king, I was a moth with painted wings made of cloth.
When did the flame burn so high and get so hot?
Oh, oh.
I don't fly around your fire anymore.
I don't fly around your fire anymore.
Burned and fallen down so many times before.
I don't fly around, fly around.
Fly around.

26,27,"In the here and now I wait.
Down among the young and the old.
With the moon and the ground I play.
With my children in my home.
This is for the daughters and sons.
Of forgotten ones, learning how to stand.
This is for the innocent unknowns.
Buried in the sand.
All running from the sound of a gun.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Until you're weary.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Running from the sound of a gun.
From the crack in the blackness I wake.
It's getting closer every night.
And my city, the playground, is a battleground.
Between the wrong and the right.
I could run free as a child, I was safe and wild.
Naked and unarmed.
Now I'm grown and safe in my home.
But some will never stop.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Until you're weary.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Running from the sound of a gun.
The open mouth of the city.
Swallowed up the town.
With that same old concrete.
That I still walk down.
And it seemingly put a shine.
On this place when I was young.
And maybe I just don't see it now.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Until I'm weary.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Running from the sound of a gun.
Running from, running from the sound of a gun.

27,28,"Just like a rescue of a stray dog in the rain.
I was hungry when you found me.
And you could tell by my tail and my rib cage.
What was once around me.
I've been chased by a rain cloud.
I was lost and nearly drowned.
And kicked around but now I'm found.
And I won't run away.
Bless your heart you gave me a home.
And a new start, and I will leave you never.
Sleep at your feet and stand guard.
At your front door, I will keep things together.
I've been chased by a rain cloud.
I was lost and nearly drowned.
And kicked around but now I'm found.
And I won't run away.
I killed myself, threw away my mental health.
But nobody was blinking an eye.
Backyard, basement, falling on the pavement.
Nothing left to say but goodbye.
Nothing left to say but goodbye.
It's true I ran away before but be sure.
I am no tail-chaser.
I know a good thing when it throws me a bone.
I'm your best friend forever.
I've been chased by a rain cloud.
I was lost and nearly drowned.
And kicked around but now I'm found.

28,29,"You give me a heart attack.
You look like the summertime.
You call me an artifact.
But I'll save that for another time.

Keep your love inside the kitchen.
You can feed me anything.
Leave the feathers on the chicken.
Peel the leather from your skin.
I could be young or old.
Sweet or sad, hot or cold.
Man or animal, I don't care at all.
Find the antidote underneath the dose.
Man or animal, obedient, out of control.
I will love you more than money.
I will breathe you in the smoke.
I will drink you in my honey.
Sweet and golden down my throat.
When you're right, when you're wrong.
Head is near, eyes are gone.
You can drown my appetite.
I will sip your tears at night.
You can tie me to a chair.
Skin and bones, I don't care.
I could be rich or poor.
I don't need anymore.
Man or animal, I don't care at all.
Find the antidote underneath the dose.
Man or animal, obedient, out of control.
Hey!
Man or animal, I don't care at all.

God forsaken.

Drown me slowly, enfold me.

All that I took with me was a bad taste in my mouth.
Went all around the world just couldn't spit it out.
Just like ground zero was the surface of the sun.
That's a sickness, I can't fix it, not all at once.

The children woke up, and they couldn't find them.
They left before the sun came up that day.
They just drove off and left it all behind 'em (Leavin' it all behind).
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold.
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold.
They'll never get hungry.
They'll never get old and grey.
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere.
They won't make it home, but they really don't care.

50,53,"Sometimes I feel like I am drunk behind the wheel.
The wheel of possibility, however it may roll.
Give it a spin, see if you can somehow factor in.
You know there's always more than one way.
To say exactly what you mean to say.
Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?
I was waiting for an indication.
It was hard to find.
Don't matter what I say, only what I do.
I never mean to do bad things to you.
So quiet, but I finally woke up.
If you're sad, then it's time you spoke up, too.

All I have is tears.
Watch them as they fall.
I'm wishing you were here.
This was supposed to be a good time.
This was supposed to be our year.
Now there's nothing after all.
How did I get here.
I guess it doesn't really matter.
I try and pass the days.
Without you on my mind.
Without you next to me.
This is feeling like a bad dream.
I'm doin' it again.
I thought about you one more time.

54,59,"I thought I saw you kneeling.
And holding your gut last night.
It looked like you were praying.
But I heard someone saying.
You had been in an awful fight.
You get the worst of it everytime.
Lashing out with no reason or rhyme.
To loose all this rage at so tender an age.
Little baby growing up in a rat cage.
Are you ready for the fallout?
Who you gonna call out?
When does it finally come to blows?
I think that you're forgetting.
The blood that you'll be letting.
Has a price on it, no one knows.
You may be suffering in your sleep.
You may be getting in way too deep.
And you may not care for advice that I share.
In one ear and out the other.
Soon you will learn how to swallow a tear.
So when you're old you can cry in your beer.
Do you spit at the face staring back in the mirror?
Do you have any self respect?

55,60,"When I saw you on TV.
You were wearing a piece of me.
And it breaks my heart to look around.
And see the unimpressed.
Who can't believe the emperor is dressed.
Turn on my TV, I wanna take some action.
If ya got no video.
Well then folks don't wanna know.
But with you up there to light the way.
I can wear a smile as I survey.
The faces in the dark.
Waiting for you to hit one out of the park.
They notice every tiny little detail.
And every word we read we'll take to heart.
Never really understand until you realize.
There are no lies.
When you see that look in his eyes.
What are we gonna use to fill these empty spaces.
When you see her in the crowd.
Will you make your momma proud?
She can turn around and see those faces looking at her son.
Climbing his way up to number one.
Scratching his way up to number one.

57,62,"My dirty fingers moved about.
To make a mess of everything around me.
I don't claim to know my way.
I still run in circles every day.
Running around half blind.
Life can be unkind.
But it's better than it was.
It's better than it was.
It's better than it was.
I complain very little becuase.
It's better than it was.
I get to remembering.
We had a lot more money then.
To make a mess of everything around us.
Now the money comes and goes.
A bit faster than my confidence grows.
Everybody knows.
There ain't nothing new about money woes.
It's better than it was.
It's better than it was.
It's better than we ever could have wished it to before.
It was bad awhile ago, better this I know.
It's better than it was.
But it's better than it was.
It's better than it was.

59,64,"Bleeding in her bed.
Her ghost has come to stay.
Oh, you can try, you can't chase her away.
In the bar we sit like blackbirds.
With our broken wings.
Like clocks without their springs.
Just like time doesn't mean anything.
Won't you tell me.
Which way to the top?
You know that I can't stay.
Down here.
We used to ride around in a broken down old car.
But now I'm changing trains.
Oh, and I'll hit all the notes in between.
Mom and Dad are fast asleep now.
But I'll be wide awake.
A surfer in the break.
Oh, just waiting for the perfect wave.
And a place in the shade.
Won't you tell me.
Which way to the top?
You know that I can't stay.
Down here.
You better get it now while.

60,65,"Decorated in a candy glaze.
Each pretty ink blot panel.
Tells a different tale.
Each photo on the mantle.
Sweet memories that never will go stale.
I've been climbing up the walls again.
Living with a memory that might have been.
So pick me up on a weekday night.
We could get together and ride around in.
The black and white.
I've been thinking about the good old days.
My silly clothes and my silly ways.
Each drunken drugstore purchase.
Each chemical advance.
Seven days a weekend.
Every day the same old dizzy dance.

61,66,"Slow drag and I'm lying in my bed.
All the world is sleeping like a baby tonight.
I wanna lay you down.
In the ground, alright.
Slow drag and I can't get up now.
Slow drag. You've been messing with my mind.
All the world is sleeping like a baby tonight.
I wanna see you dead.
Laying in the muddy ground.
You're nothing to me.
Nothing to me.
Nothing to me no more.

Remember... the way that it used to be.
Do you remember our car?
Do you remember our house?
Do you remember what it was like?
Cause this, this is not my life.
(My life, my life).
Now I live in the shadows.
(My life, my life).
Because you are my life.

You're the only one.

You took away my life.
You took away my reason to live.

63,68,"Bought a copy of ""Revolver"" and some Gang of Four.
Singles going steady.
Billie Holliday.
They had it all on vinyl.
And I was blown away.
Then I walked around the corner to my favorite bar.
I do a lot more walkin' since I wrecked my car.
They all know my name here.
I feel right at home.
I just might spend the night here.
Since I know you're not alone.
And then they play that song I love.
And I feel like I just can't lose.
I feel like I should call you up.
But I'll stay here all night.
'Till I get it right.
Well I wrote you a letter but I tore it up.
Then I wrote another letter and I tore it up.
Stare up at the ball game.
On the TV screen.
If you care to find me.
You'll know where I'll be.
And then they play that song I love.
And I feel like I just can't lose.
I feel like I should call you up.
But I'll stay here all night.
'Till I get it right.
I'm down.
I'm down.

64,69,"Through the window dimly shines.
Its final statement at the closing of the day.
I've got a few more minutes of night time before I rise.
As the dawn is breaking through the darkness.
The morning star will fade but never die.
Morning star, I can't see your face no more, and that's good.
Get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood.
As I laid down last night I felt no pain.
The day went on without a sound.
Another night to put all the business away.
I had a few more hours of night time before I'd rise.
All the stars were out last night in the sky.
I slept right through as they all went by.
Soon the dawn was breaking up the darkness.
The morning star will fade but never die.
Morning star, I can't see your face no more, and that's good.
Get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood.
You come along with a color that I can't match.
Gold chain and a crystal ball attached.
You're coming from the wrong direction.
And as I sleep tonight I'll dream of you.
Sleeping somewhere far away.
You come into my head so pretty and so true.
I get a few more hours to dream of you till I rise.
As the fireworks shoot off in the sky.
I sleep right through as it all goes by.
Soon the darkness would suck up into the dawn.
The morning star will fade but never die.
Morning star, I can't see your face no more, and that's good.
Get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood.
You come along with a code that I can't crack.
Gold chain and a crystal ball attached.
You were coming from the wrong direction.
You were coming from the wrong direction.
You were coming from the wrong direction.

65,70,"Want champagne all they got is cabernet.
And I'm wasting all my time.
I feel good but there's a tear in my eye.
Rain falling from a cloudless sky.
I get high, forget about it all.
Red light flashing behind my cracked up rearview mirror.
Thunder crashing down and screaming in my ear.
I guess I drew a bad card somewhere down the line.
And I'll never win my money all back.
I'm only here for a limited time.
Probably see me hanging around by the railroad tracks.
I get high.
We used to have a house down by the shore.
Every night we'd take a walk to the liquor store.
And we'd get wasted all the time.
I hit the city when I lost you girl.
Not so pretty it's a different world.
I get high, forget about it all.
Red light flashing behind my cracked up rearview mirror.
Thunder crashing down and screaming in my ear.
I guess I drew a bad card somewhere down the line.
And I'll never win my money all back.
I'm only here for a limited time.
And then I got a bag to pack.
I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down.
Too bad I don't get my own way.
Maybe you and me can try to get together someday.
Because I'm wasting all my time.
I feel good, but there's a tear in my eye.
Rain falling from a cloudless sky.
I get high, forget about it all.
I get high, forget about it all.

66,71,"There's something on the tracks.
It's a dead end waiting and we can't go back.
So take it to the highway.
Head back and open wide.
Step right up and take a nowhere ride.
It's a nowhere road, it's a nowhere road.
No matter where it goes, it's a nowhere road.
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired.
It's a nowhere road and I'm fired.
It don't matter what they say.
You can't get there going this way.
From L.A. to Miami, and all points in between.
Look outside you get the same old scene.
You take it to the highway.
You travel far and wide.
Caterpillars carving up the country side.
It's a nowhere road, it's a nowhere road.
No matter where it goes, it's a nowhere road.

67,72,"It might break your heart, but the physical risk is low.
You might feel so bad that you wanna die.
But if you died you would never know.
That it didn't kill you.
Soon you would've felt better.
Are you happy in heaven?
Do you win all the games that they play up there?
Do you have a new body?
What kind of wings do you wear?
I haven't felt so bad that I wanted to die.
But if I died I would never know.
Love doesn't kill you.
It's supposed to make you feel better.
You're never going to feel any better.
Once you're dead, you don't get any deader.
And you get no lovin' but you feel no pain.
Never have to lose again.
I just wish you could've been a bit bolder.
Now you're never gonna get any older.
And I really do miss you, but how would you know?
Is that the only way to go?
Love doesn't kill you.
But you can't run away from the bare inside.
You can't just quit right right here.

68,73,"How I'm sitting on one right now.
You could warn me about candles at both ends burning.
From the outside in.

You need to feel the loss.
'Cause love is expensive and free.

But still I dream.
Of warm sunny days on 12th and Lorraine.
I wish you were here right now, but then.

The ground moved under me.
I pushed her away with the things I'd say.

With pretty boys and plastic girls.
Broken hearts, vanities that disease.
I hear my music on the radio.
What's that song from long ago they're still playing.
Is it saying anything to you.
Pretty people in the magazines.
Play the part of kings and queens.
Hair and make-up can cover up the ugly truth.

Too sad for me to play.

I wake up with memories in my head.
I'm somewhere else instead.
Falling upstairs to you.

You're running through my head, like a melody.
I think about you all the time.
I push play and then rewind, endlessly.
And since I seen your face, I just can't forget.
I need you more and more.
I crave you like a cigarette.
Standing on your crooked street.
Silent prayer I repeat, endlessly.
I will wait, for you.
Through the night, for you.
I pay my dues, I sing the blues, I wait for you.
I wait for your tender touch.
You've become my crutch.
I'm faithful still.
You bend my will, Angelie.
Angelie you fascinate me.
You're a mystery.
You're original as sin.
A tattoo on my skin, Angelie.
I will wait for you.
Through the night, for you.
I pay my dues, I sing the blues, I wait for you.
I wait for your tender touch.
You've become my crutch.
I'm faithful still.
You bend my will, Angelie.
Angelie you fascinate me.
You're a mystery.

Lights go out and your head starts spinnin'.
Someone got you hypnotized.
Down on the chain, your bad tuxedo.
Brother, can you spare a dime?
Count what's left when it's all gone wrong.
How you gonna make it right?
How you gonna make it right?
How you gonna make it right?
Gonna make it right.
Gonna make it right.

My desperation, a spinning top.
Revolving on and on a world that never stops.
Is it all mine? How could I know?
We threw the rind away, swallowed all the core.
Tried levitation, you're not alone.
The stars are holding open a door we'll never close.

Say have you heard the news today.
One flag was taken down.
To raise another in its place.
A heavy cross you bear.
A stubborn heart remains unchanged.
No home, no life, no love.
No stranger singing in your name.
Maybe the season.
The colors change in the valley skies.
Dear God, I've sealed my fate.
Running through hell, heaven can wait.
Long road to ruin there in your eyes.
Under the cold streetlights.
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight.
Let's say we take this town.
No king or queen of any state.
Get up to shut it down.
Open the streets and raise the gates.
I know one wall to scale.
I know a field without a name.
Head on without a care.
Before it's way too late.
Maybe the season.
The colors change in the valley skies.
Oh, God, I've sealed my fate.
Running through hell, heaven can wait.

No tomorrow, no dead end in sight.
For every piece to fall in place.
Forever gone without a trace.
Your horizon takes its shape.
No turning back, don't turn that page.
Come now, I'm leaving here tonight.
Come now, let's leave it all behind.
Is that the price you pay?
Running through hell, heaven can wait.
Long road to ruin there in your eyes.
Under the cold streetlights.
No tomorrow, no dead ends.

To the sound of candles burning out.
Heavy from writing your resignations.
Licking bitter envelopes, blood on your tongue.

Swing it round I'll spin your noose.
You let it down.
I'll hang around with you, till you find someone better.
When there's no one left to use, and everyone keeps going down.

Down on the corner of 14th and U.

Took all the windows from prisons and schools.

You start untying the hand of the youth.

Mother nature, your summer is coming.
Yesterday and today.
Revolution on its way.

Salvation at the ready.
You look when I walked by.
Still screaming ""'til I die"".
You can't find peace if you can't find a home.
You can't survive as an island alone.
Black heart with a gaping wound.
Put back together by a troubled groove.
Check yourself, wreck your brains.
Where is that P.M.A.?

And haunt the ground we're from.

200,221,"Once upon a time I was somebody else.
In another life, I saw myself.
Way back then, back when I was new.
Somewhere down the line I started to slip.
Years gone by, biting my lip.
All the while, all this time I knew.
Now, you're on your own, one for the pages.
Over the hill and through the ages.
Does my heaven burn like hell on you?
Out beneath the cracks and comin' in waves.
Rollin' like an earthquake under the pavement.

How'd the simple life get so complicated?
Shoes to fill, secrets to spill down you.
Deer in the headlights, spoke in the wheel.
You want pretend, I need for real.
I'm takin' it back, all my IOU's.
You gotta lot of nerve, nerve.

Bleeding hearts like mine.
Chasing birds through the sky.
And deep into the black.
Chasing birds, say goodbye.
I'm never coming back.

Stay there, soft and blue. Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight.
Sweetest invitation, breaking the day in two.
Feeling like I do, Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight.

In the morning wind we're through and tomorrow rescues you.

They're just fucking words.
This is life or death.
It's time to clear the air, you better save your breath.
Say have you heard, say have you heard.
The poison in my heart and voices in my head?

Yeah, while I'm still around.

Made my peace and now I'm through.
This is the last song.
That I will dedicate to you.
And yours is a name.
I will never name again.

Relive the here and now.
To see you now and then.
I'm a revolving door.
I've seen it all before.
I will begin again.

I took a look around.
I believe in hand me downs.
The treasures that we found.
When we were brand new.
Now that we're old and worn.
A little ripped and torn.
One day we'll be reborn.
One day I will meet you right back here.

Stop me so I can begin.
End over end, end over end.
End over end, I'm circling.
End over end, end over end.
End over end, I'm circling.
I'm feeling out of luck.
Maybe I just feel too much.
That old familiar touch.
Will always sting my skin.
The good in everyone.
The ties we've left undone.
The heart that moves your blood.
All the things that bring me right back here.

246,269,"Winding your way down on Baker Street.
Light in your head and dead on your feet.
Another crazy day.
You drink the night away.
And forget about everything.
This city's dance makes you feel so cold.
It's got so many people but it's got no soul.
And it's taken you so long.
To find out you were wrong.
When you thought it held everything.
Used to think that it was so easy.
Used to say that it was so easy.
But you're trying, you're trying now.
Another year and then you'll be happy.
Just one more year and then you'll be happy.
But you're crying, you're crying now.
Way down the street there's a light in his place.
Opens the door, he's got that look on his face.
And he asks you where you've been.
You tell him who you've seen.
And you talk about everything.
He's got this dream about buying some land.
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands.
And then he'll settle down.
In this quiet little town.
And forget about everything.
But you know he'll always keep moving.
You know, he's never gonna stop moving.
'Cause he's rolling, he's a rolling stone.

The sun is shining, it's a new morning.

And show you everything.
See you in hell.
See you in hell.
We'll gather around the fire.
And I will lead the choir.
Sing Farewell.
See you in hell.
Come break, my spell.
We'll drown the wishing well.
We'll find some time to time to kill.
I'll be, right there.
The buzz inside your head.
The whole electric chair.
See you in hell.
We'll gather around the fire.
And I will lead the choir.
Sing Farewell.
See you in hell.

Hold in wonder, spoke and wheel.

We call it Riding the Gravy Train.
We're just knocked out.
We heard about the sell out.
You gotta get an album out.
You owe it to the people.
We're so happy we can hardly count.

Burn away my pride.

There behind the skies.
Walking on the embers.
Standing in their light?

The hardest part is waiting here.
Waiting to collide.

With a gun in your back.
For a bowl of rice a day.
Slave for soldiers.

Now you can go where they get things done.

So out of key.
Broken on a ship of fools.

And I just couldn't believe my eyes.
She had so many devices.
Everything that money could buy.
She said sign your name on the dotted line.
The lights went out.

The castle started spinning.
Or maybe it was my brain.
I can't tell you what she did to me.
But my body will never be the same.
Her lovin' will kick your behind.

But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind.

Nikki wasn't there.
I looked all over and all I found.
Was a phone number on the stairs.

Time is a valuable thing.

Watch it count down to the end of the day.
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal).
Didn't look out below.
Watch the time go right out the window.

Thinking everything's about me.
Yeah, I drive myself crazy.
'Cause I cant escape the gravity.
I'm holding on.
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on.
So much more than I can carry.
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down.
If I just let go, I'd be set free.
Holding on.
Why is everything so heavy?
You say that I'm paranoid.
But Im pretty sure the world is out to get me.
Its not like I make the choice.
To let my mind stay so fucking messy.
I know I'm not the center of the universe.
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same.
I know I'm not the center of the universe.

"
269,294,"I got a long way to go.
And a long memory.
I been searching for an answer.
Always just out of reach.
Blood on the floor.
Sirens repeat.
I been searching for the courage.
To face my enemies.
When they turn down the lights.
I hear my battle symphony.
All the world in front of me.
If my armor breaks.
Ill fuse it back together.
Battle symphony.
Please just dont give up on me.
And my eyes are wide awake.
For my battle symphony.
For my battle symphony.
They say that I dont belong.
Say that I should retreat.
That Im marching to the rhythm.
Of a lonesome defeat.
But the sound of your voice.
Puts the pain in reverse.
No surrender, no illusions.
And for better or worse.
When they turn down the lights.
I hear my battle symphony.
All the world in front of me.
If my armor breaks.
Ill fuse it back together.
Battle symphony.
Please just dont give up on me.
And my eyes are wide awake.
If I fall, get knocked down.
Pick myself up off the ground.
If I fall, get knocked down.
Pick myself up off the ground.
When they turn down the lights.
I hear my battle symphony.
All the world in front of me.

Please just dont give up on me.
And my eyes are wide awake.
For my battle symphony.
For my battle symphony.
"
270,295,"Memories consume like opening the wound.
I'm picking me apart again.
You all assume I'm safe here in my room.
Unless I try to start again.
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose.
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused.
I don't know what's worth fighting for.
Or why I have to scream.
I don't know why I instigate.
And say what I don't mean.
I don't know how I got this way.
I know it's not alright.
So I'm breaking the habit.
I'm breaking the habit tonight.
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door.
I try to catch my breath again.
I hurt much more than anytime before.
I had no options left again.
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose.
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused.
I don't know what's worth fighting for.
Or why I have to scream.
I don't know why I instigate.
And say what I don't mean.
I don't know how I got this way.
I'll never be alright.
So I'm breaking the habit.
I'm breaking the habit tonight.
I'll paint it on the walls.
'Cause I'm the one at fault.
I'll never fight again.
And this is how it ends.
I don't know what's worth fighting for.
Or why I have to scream.
But now I have some clarity.
To show you what I mean.
I don't know how I got this way.
I'll never be alright.
So I'm breaking the habit.
I'm breaking the habit.
I'm breaking the habit tonight.
"
271,296,"In this farewell.
There's no blood, there's no alibi.
'Cause I've drawn regret.
From the truth of a thousand lies.
So let mercy come and wash away.
What I've done.
I'll face myself.
To cross out what I've become.
Erase myself.
And let go of what I've done.
Put to rest what you thought of me.
While I clean this slate.
With the hands of uncertainty.
So let mercy come and wash away.
What I've done.
I'll face myself.
To cross out what I've become.
Erase myself.
And let go of what I've done.
For what I've done.
I start again.
And whatever pain may come.
Today this ends.
I'm forgiving.
What I've done.
I'll face myself.
To cross out what I've become.
Erase myself.
And let go of what I've done.

All the walls that you keep building.
All this time that I spent chasing.
All the ways that I keep losing you.

273,298,"Take me down to the river bend.
Take me down to the fighting end.
Wash the poison from off my skin.
Show me how to be whole again.
Fly me up on a silver wing.
Past the black where the sirens sing.
Warm me up in a nova's glow.
And drop me down to the dream below.
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass.
Hardly anything there for you to see.
For you to see.
Bring me home in a blinding dream.
Through the secrets that I have seen.
Wash the sorrow from off my skin.
And show me how to be whole again.

274,299,"(When this began) I had nothing to say.
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me.
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find.
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind.
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed.
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel.
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone.
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own.
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real.
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long.
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone).
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real.
I wanna find something I've wanted all along.
Somewhere I belong.
And I've got nothing to say.
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face.
(I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find.
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind.
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me.
(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone.
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own.
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real.
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long.

And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed.
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me.

275,300,"I'm dancing with my demons.
I'm hanging off the edge.
Storm clouds gather beneath me.
Waves break above my head.
Headfirst hallucination.
I wanna fall wide awake now.
You tell me it's alright.
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight.
But nobody can save me now.
I'm holding up a light.
I'm chasing out the darkness inside.
'Cause nobody can save me.
Stared into this illusion.
For answers yet to come.
I chose a false solution.
But nobody proved me wrong.
Headfirst hallucination.
I wanna fall wide awake.
Watch the ground giving way now.
You tell me it's alright.
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight.
But nobody can save me now.

276,301,"I am a little bit of loneliness.
A little bit of disregard.
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact.

277,302,"I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared.
But no one would listen 'cause no one else cared.
After my dreaming, I woke with this fear.
What am I leaving when I'm done here?
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know.
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done.
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed.
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty.
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest.
Leave out all the rest.
Don't be afraid.

Takes me one step closer to the edge.

Waiting to let me know.

We're building it up to burn it down.
We can't wait to burn it to the ground.
The colors conflicted.
As the flames climbed into the clouds.

I played soldier, you played king.

You lost that right to hold that crown.
I built you up but you let me down.

Never gonna be another one, no.

So conditioned, I could never let go.
Then sorrow, then sickness.
Then the shock when you flip it on me.
So hollow, so vicious.
So afraid, I couldn't let myself see.
That I could never be held.
Back or up, no, I hold myself.
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well.
Forget the rest, let them know my Hell.
There and back, yet my soul ain't sell.

How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?

Been crossed and lost and told no.

Stuck in my head again.
Feels like I'll never leave this place, there's no escape.
I'm my own worst enemy.
I've given up, I'm sick of feeling.
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating.
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me.

Watching the raindrops blinking red and white.

Forgot all about yesterday.
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore.
A little taste of hypocrisy.

With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade.

Wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take a shot time.
While you're waiting for a purpose, I already got mine.

(You say!) You'll let me understand.
(You say!) You're gonna hold me to your word.
And if I sell myself away.
(You say!) I'll have no debt to pay.
(You say!) I'm gonna get what I deserve.
Your word, obeyed.
My debt, repaid.
Our trust, betrayed.
All for nothing! All for nothing!
Kick back, there's no other way to say it.
So let me break this fucker down for you, I really don't know you.
You talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia.
You're joking, I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw you.
I'm disgusted.
Wonder what could've made you tuck your tail below you.
And no, I'm not your soldier, I'm not taking any orders.
I'm a five-star general infantry controller.
Need a lesson? Let me show you.
Have you checking your composure.

""Give me back what's mine!"".
I'd never been a coward, I'd never seen blood.
You'd sold me an ocean, and I was lost in the flood.
We were counting on a leader, we were driven by need.
But couldn't take temptation, and we were blinded by greed.
You were steady as a sniper, we were waiting on a wire.
So we never saw it coming when you ran from the fire.
You can try intimidation and you can try to ignore.
But when the time comes calling, yeah, you are gonna get yours.
Another day, your truth will come.

This business of burning human beings with napalm.
Of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows.
Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate.

Of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields.
Physically handicapped and psychologically deranged.

Aw yeah, yeah!
You've been dying since the day you were born.
You know it's all been planned.
The quartet of deliverance rides.
A sinner once a sinner twice.
No need for confession now.
'Cause now you have got the fight of your life.
The horsemen are drawing nearer.
On the leather steeds they ride.
They've come to take your life.
On through the dead of night.
With the four horsemen ride.
Or choose your fate and die.
Aw yeah, yeah!
Time! Has taken its toll on you.
The lines that crack your face.
Famine! Your body, it has torn through.
Withered in every place.
Pestilence! For what you've had to endure.
And what you have put others through.
Death! Deliverance for you for sure.
Now there's nothing you can do.
So gather round, young warriors now.
And saddle up your steeds.
Killing scores with demon swords.
Now's the death of doers of wrong.
Swing the judgment hammer down.
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat.
The horsemen are drawing nearer.
On the leather steeds they ride.
They've come to take your life.
On through the dead of night.
With the four horsemen ride.
Or choose your fate and die.

349,386,"Dear mother, dear father.
What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer, deceiver.
Day in, day out, lived my life through you.
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right.
Hidden from this thing that they call life.
Dear mother, dear father.
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove.
Curator, dictator.
Always censoring my every move.
Children are seen but are not heard.
Tear out everything inspired.
Innocence, torn from me without your shelter.
Barred reality, I'm living blindly.
Dear mother, dear father.
Time has frozen still, what's left to be?
Hear nothing, say nothing.
Cannot face the fact I think for me.
No guarantee it's life as is.
But damn you for not giving me my chance.
Dear mother, dear father.
You clipped my wings before I learned to fly.
Unspoiled, unspoken.
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby.
Same thing I've always heard from you.
Do as I say, not as I do.
Innocence, torn from me without your shelter.
Barred reality, I'm living blindly.
I'm in hell without you.
Cannot cope without you two.
Shocked at the world that I see.
Innocent victim, please rescue me.
Dear mother, dear father.

There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fucking mad.
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it, oh, so bad.
Adrenaline starts to flow.
You're thrashing all around.
Acting like a maniac.
Whiplash!
Bang your head against the stage like you never did before.
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore.
In a frenzied madness with your leathers and your spikes.
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight.
Adrenaline starts to flow.
You're thrashing all around.
Acting like a maniac.
Whiplash!
Here on stage, the Marshall noise is piercing through your ears.
It kicks your ass, kicks your face, exploding feeling nears.

We're gathered here to maim and kill, cause this is what we choose.
Adrenaline starts to flow.
You're thrashing all around.
Acting like a maniac.
Here we go!
Whiplash!

351,388,"On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha.
You can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song.
You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before.
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do.
When you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do.
You don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through.
But here I am, on the road again.
There I am, up on the stage.
There I go, playing the star again.
There I go, turn the page.
So you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road.
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold.
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode.
And most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can.
All the same old cliches: is it woman? Is it man?
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand, make your stand.
But here I am, on the road again.
There I am, up on the stage.
Here I go, playing the star again.
There I go, turn the page.
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away.
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away.
And the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play.
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed.
With the echoes of the amplifiers, ringing in your head.
You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said.
What she said.
But here I am, on the road again.
There I am, up on the stage.
Here I go, playing the star again.
There I go, turn the page.
There I go, turn that page.
There I go, yeah, there I go, yeah.
There I go, yeah, here I go.
There I go, there I go.

509,560,"Talking to the songbird yesterday.
Flew me to a place not far away.
She's a little pilot in my mind.
Singing songs of love to pass the time.
Going to write a song so she can see.
Give her all the love she gives to me.
Talk of better days that have yet to come.
Never felt this love from anyone.
She's not anyone.
She's not anyone.
She's not anyone.
A man can never dream these kinds of things.
Especially when she came and spread her wings.
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like.
Then she flew away into the night.
Going to write a song so she can see.
Give her all the love she gives to me.
Talk of better days that have yet to come.

Here's a song.
It reminds me of when we were young.
Looking back at all the things we've done.
You gotta keep on keeping on.
Out to sea.
Is the only place I honestly.
Can get myself some piece of mind.
You know it's getting hard to fly.
If I'm to fall.
Would you be there to applaud.
Or would you hide behind them all.
'Cause if I have to go.
In my heart you grow.
And that's where you belong.
If I'm to fall.
Would you be there to applaud.
Or would you hide behind them all.
'Cause if I have to go.
In my heart you grow.
And that's where you belong.
If I'm to fall.
Would you be there to applaud.
Or would you hide behind them all.
'Cause if I have to go.
In my heart you grow.
And that's where you belong.
Guess I'm out of time.
I'm out of time.
I'm out of time.
I'm out of time.
I'm out of time.

It's every Englishman's inalienable right to live where the hell he likes.
What's it going to do, vanish?
Is it not going to be there when I get back?).

Calling out to all.
We live a dying dream.
If you know what I mean.
All that I've ever known.
It's all that I've ever known.

I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide.
I tried to talk with God to no avail.
Calling him in and out of nowhere.
I said if you won't save me please don't waste my time.

Sipping your champagne.

While you're sniffing your cocaine.
I'm a man of choice in an old Rolls Royce.
And I'm howling at the moon.
Is this happening too deafening.
For you?
For you?
It's maybe the fame.
Forgotten your name.
It's sees you cry, you never did explain.

Oh, try and mimic, what's insane.
I am in it, where do I stand?
Hm, Indian summer and I hate the heat.
I got a back street lover on the passenger seat.
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet, I pray.
Once upon a time I could control myself.
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah.

But I've been looking at you the whole fucking time.

Hand on my face, pushed to the ground.
Enmity gauged, united by fear.
Forced to endure what I could not forgive.

The wounds in the mirror waved.
It wasn't my surface.

I gathered speed from you fucking with me.
Once and for all, I'm far away.
Hard to believe, finally the shades are raised.
Hey, yeah.
Saw things so much clearer.

I been beaten down.
I feel that I'm done believing.
Now the truth is coming out.
What they've taken.
Is more than a vow.
They've taken your innocence.
And then they throw 'em on a burning pile.
All along they're saying.
""Mind your manners!"".
I caught myself believing.
That I needed God.
And if it's out there somewhere.
We sure could use hymn now.
Try my patience.
My patience tried.
This world's a long love letter.
That makes me want to cry, ah ah ay ay.
All along they're saying.
""Mind your manners!"".
That's all they're saying.
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed.
May not live another life.
May not solve all mysteries.
Right around the corner.
Could be bigger than ourselves.
We could will it to the sky.
Or we could something else.
And all along they're saying.

The slightest bit of light and I can see you clear.
Oh, had to take your hand, and feel your breath.
For fear this someday will be over.
I pull you close, so much to lose.
Knowing that nothing lasts forever.
I didnt care, before you were here.
I danced in laughter, with the ever after.
But all things change, let this remain.
Hear the sirens covering distance in the night.
The sound echoing closer, will they come for me next time?

To send you in the arms of another man.
And if you choose to stay, Ill wait, Ill understand.

I don't want to hear from those who know.
They can buy but can't put on my clothes.
I don't want to limp for them to walk.
Never would have known of me before.
I don't want to be held in your debt.
I'll pay it off in blood, let I be wed.
I'm already cut up and half dead.
I'll end up alone like I began.
Everything has chains.
Absolutely nothing's changed.
Take my hand, not my picture.
Spilled my tincture.

I would rather starve than eat your breast.
All the things that others want for me.
Can't buy what I want because it's free.
Can't buy what I want because it's free.
Can't be what you want because I....

Know a man, his face seemed pulled and tense.
Like he's riding on a motorbike in the strongest winds.
So I approach with tact, suggest that he should relax.
But he's always moving much too fast.
Said he'll see me on the flip side of this trip he's taking for a ride.
He's been taking too much on.
There he goes with his perfectly unkempt clothes.
There he goes.
He's yet to come back but I've seen his picture.
It doesn't look the same up on the rack.
We go way back.
I wonder about his insides.
It's like his thoughts are too big for his size.
He's been taken, where? I don't know.
Off he goes with his perfectly unkept hope.
There he goes.
And now I rub my eyes for he has returned.
Seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned.
For he still smiles, and he's still strong.
Nothing's changed but the surrounding bullshit; That has grown.
And now he's home and we're laughing like we always did.
My same old, same old friend.

He seems distracted and I know just what is gonna happen next.

Kashmir then Marrakech.
The lengths we had to go to then.
To find a place Trump hadn't fucked up yet.
Living life on the back porch.
Lifting rocks to make a wage.
Every sunset paid attention to.
Not a starry night went to waste.
Had to quick escape.
Had to quick escape.

Craters across the skyline.
A sleep sack in a bivouac.

It's sad, he could only love you.
It's sad.
Holding his last breath.
Believing he'll make his way.
But she's not forgotten.
He's haunted, he's searching for escape.
If just one wish could bring her back.
It's sad, and his loneliness is proof.
It's sad, he could only love you.
It's sad.
"
701,772,"Why deny all the troubles.
When combined with the missing links.
It don't feel like home now.
That you're gone, all the trouble suddenly explained.
Infinitum, you're always wishing and never here at home, you....
All the dreams we shared and lights we turned on.
But the house is getting dark.
And I don't want to know your past.
But together, share the dawn.
And I won't need nothing else.
'Cause when we're dead, we would have had it all.
And died, I would've fallen from the sky to you.
Parachutes have opened now.
Heaven knows if there's a ceiling.
Come so low with the kneeling.
Please know that I got.
All the friends I'm needing.
Before my light goes out.
As the doors are closing now.
And far away will be my home.
And to grasp this, I don't know.
But I don't need, further back and forth.
A wave will break on me today.
And love? Wish the world could go again with love.
One can't seem to have enough.
And war? Break the sky and tell me what it's for.
I'll travel there on my own.
And love? What a different life.
Had I not found this love with you.
"
702,773,"Here's a token of my openness.
Of my need to not disappear.
How I'm feeling, so revealing to me.
I found my mind too clear.
I just need someone to be there for me.
I just want someone to be there for me.
All the static in my attic-a.
Shoots down my sciatic nerve.
To the ocean of my platitudes.
Longitudes, latitudes, it's so absurd.
I just need someone to be there for....
I just want someone to be there for, someone to be there for me.
'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference.
I'm not trying to make a difference.
I'll stop trying to make a difference.

703,774,"Underneath this smile lies everything.
All my hopes and anger, pride and shame.
I make myself a pact not to shut doors on the past.
Just for today, I am free.
I will not lose my faith.
It's an inside job today.
I know this one thing well.
I used to try to kill love, it was the highest sin.
Breathing insecurity out and in.
Searching hope, I'm shown the way to run straight.
Pursuing the greater way for all human light.
How I choose to feel is how I am.
How I choose to feel is how I am.
I will not lose my faith.
It's an inside job today.
Holding on, the light of the night.
On my knees to rise and fix my broken soul again.
Let me run into the rain.
To be a human light again.
Let me run into the rain.
To shine a human light today.

Oh, life comes from within my heart and desire.

Blood is on the table.

In the form of a morning paper.
Laid out for me to see.
Saw his face in a corner picture.
I recognized the name.
Could not stop staring at the.
Face I'd never see again.
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain.
What does it mean when a war has taken over.
It's the same everyday in a hell man made.
What can be saved, and who will be left to hold her?
The whole world, world over.
It's a world wide suicide.
The whole world, world over.
It's a world wide suicide.
Medals on a wooden mantle.
Next to a handsome face.
That the president took for granted.
Writing checks that others pay.
And in all the madness.
Thought becomes numb and nave.
So much to talk about, yeah.
Nothing for to say.
It's the same everyday, the wave won't break.
Tell you to pray while the devil's on their shoulder.
Laying claim to the take that our soldiers save.
Does not equate and the truth's already out there.
The whole world, world over.
It's a world wide suicide.
The whole world, world over.
It's a world wide suicide.
Looking in the eyes of the fallen.
You got to know there's another.
Another, another, another, another way.

Out of bed and he dreams in the shower.
She's standing naked and apologizing.
Reaches for her till his mind becomes blood hot.
Woken up to be burned, burned again.
Go it alone.
You got it so it goes.
Gonna breathe and I said.
""I can't take it any other way"".
On the streets he's walking wounded.
Doesn't smile for the child at play.
Thoughts of suicide and alleviation.
Anything to get his heart off of the coals.
Does he fly away or just talk about it?
Like a seagull born to cry in the wind.
Own experiences lead to a younger.
All alone you will meet the one who lies in wait.
Go it alone.

Reeling is what they say.
Or is it just my way?
Wind blows by.
Low light.
Side-tracked.
Low light.
Can't see my tracks, your scent-way back.
Can I be here all alone?
Clear a path to my home.
Blood runs dry.
Books and jealousy tell me wrong.
All I feel, calm.
Voice blows by.
Low light.
Car crash.
Low light.
Can't wear my mask, your first, my last.

Watched from the window with a red mosquito.
I was not allowed to leave the room.
I saw the sun go down and now it's coming up.
Somewhere in the time between.
I was bitten.
Must have been the devil.
He was just paying me a little visit.
Reminding me of his presence.
Letting me know he's a-waiting, oh.
Red man's your neighbor, Call it behavior.
While you're climbing up slippery hills.
Two steps ahead of him, Punctures in your neck.
Hovering just above your bed.

Why do I keep fucking up?
I can see you on the hill. Why do I?
All comatose but walking still. Why do I?
Flowing curves beneath your flowing gown. Why do I?
Oh, only I can bring myself down. Why do I?
Why do I keep fuckin up?
Bowman's pick and dogs that bite. Why do I?
Oh, dogs that howl through the night. Why do I?

They're whipping.
They're whipping.
They're whipping.

My gun.

Red sun.
And this nation's about to explode.

Well-hung.
Better pony up and bring both your barrelfulls.
Not one.
As we release this unspeakable toll (Woo!).
(Woo!).
And I stand my ground.
All alone around the world (and I stand my ground).

Death came around, forced to hear its song.
And know tomorrow can't be depended on.
I seen the home inside your head.
All locked doors and unmade beds.
Open sores unattended.
Let me say just once that.
I have faced it, a life wasted.
And I'm never going back again.
Oh, I escaped it, a life wasted.
And I'm never going back again.
Having tasted, a life wasted.
I'm never going back again.
The world awaits just up the stairs.
Leave the pain for someone else.
Nothing back there for you to find.
Or was it you you left behind?
You're always saying you're too weak to be strong.
You're harder on yourself than just about anyone.
Why swim the channel just to get this far?
Halfway there, why would you turn around?
Darkness comes in waves.
Tell me, why invite it to stay?
You're one with negativity.
Yes, comfort is an energy.
But why let the sad song play?
I have faced it, a life wasted.
And I'm never going back again.
Oh, I escaped it, a life wasted.
Oh, I'm never going back again.
Oh, having tasted, a life wasted.
I'm never going back again.
Oh, I erased it, a life wasted.

714,787,"On the side of the road.
Lost and alone.
To get it back.
Much farther to go.
So far from home.
To get it back.
Frozen in time.
Turn on a dime.
To get it back.
Try to reach you before winter comes.
Always a place for you in my heart.
You're not alone.
All used up.
I'd give anything to talk to you.
The prodigal son.
The only one.
To get it back.
The mother and child.
Theyre lost for a while.
They want you back.
Stare at the sun.
Wont hurt anyone.
To get it back.
Try to reach you before winter comes.
Always a place for you in my heart.
Youre not alone.
All used up.
Id give anything to talk to you.

715,788,"She wanted to see other people.
I thought, ""well then, look around, they're everywhere"".
Said that she was confused....
I thought, ""darling, join the club"".
24 years old, mid-life crisis.
Nowadays hits you when youre young.
I hung up, she called back, I hung up again.
The process had already started.
At least it happened quick.
I swear, I died inside that night.
My friend, he called.
I didn't mention a thing.
The last thing he said was, ""be sound"".
Sound....
I contemplated an awful thing, I hate to admit.
I just thought those would be such appropriate last words.
But I'm still here.
And small.
So small... how could this struggle seem so big?
So big....
While the palms in the breeze still blow green.
And the waves in the sea still absolute blue.
But the horror.
Every single thing I see is a reminder of her.
Never thought Id curse the day I met her.
And since she's gone and wouldn't hear.
Who would care? What good would that do?
But I'm still here.
So I imagine in a month...or twelve.
I'll be somewhere having a drink.
Laughing at a stupid joke.
Or just another stupid thing.
And I can see myself stopping short.
Drifting out of the present.
Sucked by the undertow and pulled out deep.
And there I am, standing.
Wet grass and white headstones all in rows.
And in the distance there's one, off on its own.
So I stop, kneel.
My new home....
And I picture a sober awakening, a re-entry into this little bar scene.
Sip my drink til the ice hits my lip.
Order another round.
And that's it for now.
Sorry.
Never been too good at happy endings....

I let go of a rope, thinking that's what held me back.

I can't see what's next, from this lonely overpass.
Hang my head and count my steps, as another car goes past.
All the rusted signs we ignore throughout our lives.
Choosing the shiny ones instead.
I turned my back, now there's no turning back.
No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead.

727,800,"There's a light, when my baby's in my arms.
There's a light, when the window shades are drawn.
Hesitate when I feel I may do harm to her.
Wash it off 'cause this feeling we can share.
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air.
Byzantine is reflected in our pond.
There's a cloud, but the water remains calm.
Reaching in the sun's fingers clutch the dawn to pass.
Even out, its a precious thing to bear.
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air.
Yes I know she's reached my heart in thin air.
Its not in my past to presume.
Love can keep on moving in both directions.
How to be happy and true is quest were taking on together.
Take it on, on, on, on, on.
Take it on, on, on, on, on.
There's a light when my baby's in my arms.

728,801,"My nails are bit off.
It's been a month since I've heard myself talk.
Only advantage this life's got on me.
Picture a cup in the middle of the sea.
And I fought back in my mind.
Never lets me be right....
I got memories, I got shit.
So much it don't show....
Oh, I walked the line....
When you held me in at night.
Oh, I walked the line....
When you held my hand and i....
On empty shells seem so easy to crack.
Got all these questions.
Don't know who I could even ask.
So I'll just lie down and wait for the dream.
Where I'm not ugly and you're lookin' at me.
And I'll stay in bed....
Oh, little I've seen there.
If just once I could be loved....
Oh, I'd stare back at me.
Oh, I walked the line....
When you held me in at night.
Oh, I walked the line....
When you held my hand and i.
Oh, I walked the line....
When you held me close at night.

Never held you in your eyes.

729,802,"A man lies in his bed in a room with no door.
He waits hoping for a presence, something, anything to enter.
After spending half his life searching, he still felt as blank as the ceiling at which he's staring.
He's alive, but feels absolutely nothing.
So, is he?
When he was six he believed that the moon overhead followed him.
By nine he had deciphered the illusion, trading magic for fact.
No trade-backs.
So this is what it's like to be an adult.
If he only knew now what he knew then.
I'm open.
I'm open.
Come on in.
Come on in.
Come on in.
Come on in.
I'm open.

Dream up a new self for himself.

Falling up the south marking ground.
Talking out of turn, drawing circles down.

Still, one's a crowd.
Making angels in the dirt.
Looking up, looking all around.

Like Pilate, I have a dog.
(Obeys, listens, kisses, loves).
Stunned by my own reflection.
It's looking back, sees me too clearly.
And I swore I'd never go there again.
Not unlike a friend that politely drags you down, you down, you down....

Was it?
He was okay.
But wondering.
About wandering.
Was it age?
By consequence?

Lost on a road he knew by heart.
It was like a book he read in his sleep, endlessly.
Sometimes he hid in his radio, watching others pull into their homes.
While he was drifting.

Off the line, off the side.
By the by.
As dirt turned to sand.
As if moved by sleight of hand.

Organized his few things, his coat and keys.

Lullabies to paralyze.

Skin and bone.
Cutting boards and hanging hooks.
Bloody knives, cooking books.

Swallow and chew.
Eat you alive.

They called and just let it ring.
No reply.
The door was open I swear.
Ain't no use in picking up.
You know why.
It's all my head I know.
So they tell me so.
Until my head explodes.
Into my head it goes.
Tastes so good.
Oh, but I knew it would.
Tastes so good.
Burn like a match house.
Medicate just to make you soft.
Love is blind.
Catch and release me.
What the hell were they thinking of.
You know why.

803,886,"Au revoir, adieu, goodnight.
I'm too wrong to get right.
But I can't wait forever.
I've always been alone.
A fool believes he's clever.
Don't you wanna go into the hollow?
I won't go alone.
Aren't you gonna follow?
I live behind my eyes.
Be sure to keep the surprise.
I break what I have borrowed.
That's why I always go.
Alone into tomorrow.
Don't you wanna go into the hollow?
I won't go alone.
Aren't you gonna follow?
Into the hollow.
Into the hollow.
"
804,887,"Too late to think or filter any more.
A bitter pill to swallow.
Maybe you're in a blanket haze of ephedrine.
I'm wondering where the hell you been.
So come on and right this wrong, the rope.
You got it all right.
You got a feeling.
I'd rather open up my wrist, let it go.
You got it all right.
You got a feeling.
Because devils and ropes around your neck.
Cursing them all.
And you can't hear it.
Can't hear it.
Ain't got a mind to deal with any more.
Saboteur infiltrator and maybe more.
If you're not blind and deaf.
How can we pollute your head.
So come on and right this wrong.
The rope.
And I got it all right.
I got a feeling.
You'd rather open up your wrist, let it go.
I got it all right, yeah.
I got a feeling.
There's devils and ropes around my neck.

805,888,"I don't mean to make obscene.
But even the mob know what the hell I mean.
The knot is tight, on my blindfold.
I got my flesh full of blood.
I hate rock and roll.
Some think too much, then come too soon.
I just curse the sun so I can howl at the moon.
Yeah, ooo, ah.
Yeah, ooo, ah.
Yeah, ooo, yeah, ah.
(Hah).
Don't wanna love you no more.
Don't wanna love you less.
I wanna be crushed by your sweet caress.
What's the fucking difference? We all gonna die.
You gonna do something killer?
Come on, give it a try.
Yeah, ooo, ay.

Yeah, ooo, ay.
Yeah, ooo, yeah.
Yeah, ooo, ah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

We are united, by drifting alone.
This is the army of none, got no flag, got no home.

806,889,"Where, oh, where can you be?
It's been so long since the moon has gone.
And, oh, what a wreck you've made me.
Are you there over the ocean?
Are you there up in the sky?
Until the return of my love, this lullaby.
My hope is on the horizon.
Every face, your eyes I can see.
I plead and pray though each night and day.
Our embrace is only a dream.
And as sure as days come from moments.
Each hour becomes a life's time.
When she'd left, I'd only begun this lullaby.
"
807,890,"I see you go.
Through a park in a haze.
And I don't listen.
For traffic going the same way.
A simple system, yeah.
I string 'em up.
I cut 'em down.
Dare I say.
To to to to to.
To to to to to.
To to to to to.
A perfect vision.
Some simple ways to let you know.
Free range humans all cooped up.
Naked clone is playing lame, yeah.
I string 'em up.
I cut 'em down.

808,891,"Once you're lost.
In twilights's blue.
You don't find your way.
The way finds you.
Tempt the fates.
Beware the smile.
It hides all the teeth, my dear.
What's behind them.
So glad you could stay forever.
So glad you could stay forever.
So glad you could stay forever.
So glad you could stay forever.
He steps between the trees.
A crooked man.
There's blood on the blade.
Don't take his hand.
You warm by the firelight, in twilight's blue.
Shadows creep and dance the walls.
He's creeping too.
So glad you could stay forever.
So glad you could stay forever.
So glad you could stay forever.
So glad you could stay forever.

809,892,"Saw you in a way.
Beyond figurin' out.
These lines of life.
Have been drawn and can't be removed.
Our eyes is all it took to know.
Open up your eyes.
Deep blue, glassy lake.
And swim till water and sky.
Now are one, out of two.
Oh, my bloodshot eyes.
Open up your mouth.
Touch your lips to mine.
That we may make a kiss.
That can pierce through death and survive.
Your words have branded my mind.
Still I hold your hand.
Wrapped as if a ring.
We of flesh and blood are only carrying.
It's so hard to, well, you know.
The seed waits for the reaper to sow.
Every breath an art.
The dignity to learn it can strain and break your heart.
Take all your pieces home.
You ask when you're alone, ""what is love"".
The blood is love.
"
810,893,"You're a head case with a smile.
Can't stop to make up your mind.
Education is so lame (It's so lame).
When you bitch and you moan.
You're a loose girl, I'm a guy (Hey).
You're a truth freak with a lie.
The situation is so strange.
It's a TV show (Click).
In a hotel on the phone.
You're gonna leave me, I should've known (Should've known).
And I was thinking, it's so sad.
I didn't want you to go, oh.
You want to follow the laws of man? (Yes sir).
Bloody apron, leg of lamb.
It's so hard to win.
When there's so much to lose.
Infiltrate the walls that are caving in.
It ain't a bad thing.
This ain't reality.
Infiltrate the walls that are caving in.
It ain't a bad thing.
Think of it as natural (Ah).
Second Avenue, raising Cain.
I'm a sinner, ring my bell (Ring mine).
I'll tell you what, I'd get up.
If I knew I had fell.
"
811,895,"From the moment you said why havent you kissed me yet?
I knew Id wipe that paint from your lips.
I stare the lids off your eyes.
Gone down on your dirty mind.
And end up between your hips.
Handfuls of sweat tangled hair, anytime, anywhere.
I wanna lick you too much, baby.
I just play all alone, whispering for your moan.
Forced to crawl down this line, just to touch.
I can get in, I cant get out.
I can get in, I cant get out.
Im just sweating my sheets.
I hate to see you leave.
But I love to watch you go, baby.
Twisted secret lives.
The way you bat your eyes.
Giving head, giving head, giving head.
Watch you come from above.
Im so needy for love.
Im desperate, greedy in slavery.
Sneak around from behind.
I got a one-track mind.
We got a skin on skin thing, baby.
I wanna lick you too much.
I wanna lick you too much.
I hear you comin', ooh ahh, baby.
I wanna lick you too much.
I wanna lick you too much.
I hear you comin', ooh ahh, baby.
"
812,897,"Got guns, do you wanna.
Take aim at each other?
Scratch the itch? Give the finger?
'Cause we don't care.
Anyway.
Got knives, have you seen 'em?
In your back's where we keep 'em.
And you're never gonna reach 'em.
Now that sounds fair.
Oh, this is bound to be good.
You can't, but you thought that you could.
Boy, little town.
Little king, little crown.
Hope you give, hope you give.
Why don't you just give in?
Come on, take it with a smile.
At the bottom of the pile.
You can beg, you can plead.
It won't take a thing.
Oh, this is bound to be good.
You can't, but you thought that you could.
Oh, how could you win.
Against yourself again?
You s ?

The devil's fat and ? language ?
How you like your position?
You ain't Robert Mitchum.
You're ten pounds of shit.
In a five pound bag.
Oh, this is bound to be good.
You can't, but you thought that you could.
Oh, how could you win.
Against yourself again?
"
813,898,"Huh, what?
"
814,900,"Cozied up to the toilet.
Face stuck to the floor.
I met expectations.
That I was tryin' to ignore.
Job had such patience.
I wonder, what's that like?
One hundred thousand million (Years).

So I was thinking.

Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
So these cities are sprouting.
Like a spit in the eye.
And this world isn't waiting.
It's just passin' me by.
I just peak in the window.
Looking inside.
The butcher's got a fork in your face and.
I'm standing in line?
And I was singing.
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
"
815,901,"I've been waiting.
Waiting under things that rise in the morning.
I've been holding, holding back so long.
You can own it.
Take it off my hands, do me a favor.
Nothing wasted.
Just fingerfucked and busted up all at once.
I'm so lost out on the highway.
With no direction left to go.
Everyday sit up and wonder.
Where it was I started from.
The more you've found.
The less you've been around.
The more you've found.
The less you've been around (Ah).
The more you've found.

You and I cut from same cloth.
Ripping at the seams.
Cut, snip, cut.

Look, laugh, but don't touch.
Cut you down to size.
Cut up, cut (shut up).
Cut up, cut.
You would know.
My girl's all out of focus.
It ain't no big surprise.
Daddy got his gun loaded.
Got cross hairs in his eyes.
Shut up, oh.

Loose teeth in my head.
New programs are coming in.
So rise and take your oath.
I wish we'd get away.
Drink wine and screw.
I knew someone else before.
Looked a lot like you.
And they're gone.
I'm gone.
In space.
I've been programmed as I said before....
Technology.
Just rolling, wheezing and breathing.
Eyeballs and teeth.
Words are weightless here on Earth.
Because they're free.

820,909,"Since you're gone, I sat at home.
Wonder why no I'll never be free.
But the thought of you.
Going with another guy.
No, it could never be me.
You took a ring and pawned our love away.
What can I say, I am left behind.
So I take a drink, another cigarette.
I can't forget that you once were mine.
What can I say?
I guess it wasn't meant to be, no.
But now you're gone.
It's us, your love is like a drug.
It's been so long.
Your folks have bet you're gone.
But I know that you're alive inside.
So I hope and pray you won't throw this love away.
I just wish that you still were mine.

821,910,"When I was a little boy.
I looked under the stairs.
The king and the pawns.
Were caught unawares.
Standing in the shadows.
A whisperer to be.
Just fishing in the darkness.
Of possibilities.
Just.
Look.
At you now.
Yeah.
Look at you now.
Yeah.
Oh.
Look at you now.
Among such style and grace.
Our highest hopes.
None standing still.
The running joke.
Where goes the warm embrace it fades.
Without return.
That lives to slip through fingertips and burn.
Just.
Look.
At you now.
Oh.
Look at you now.
Oh.
Look at you now.

Screaming, screaming, screaming, screaming.
Go straight in for the ultimate sin.
Nobody else ever seems to care!
So I took what I thought was mine.
And I waited for a very long time.

You told me exactly what to do.
So I did it right, I stayed up all night.
I felt like killing myself for you.
I don't think I think like I did before.
I never watched anyone die before.
I felt like I died as well.
The look, the words, the smell.
The way you looked at me.
As if I'd never been free.
I remember the words like a favorite song.

Angel On Fire.
She stands on her suitcase.
And looks out her window at me.
The smile leaves her face.
The mirror don't like what it sees.
So she hides all her secrets.
She's thinking I'll never know.
That she burns like an angel.
Into her fire she goes.
She don't miss nothing.
Even though she pretends she don't see.
Everything she's ""watching"" (?).
She puts her hand next to me.
She says give me one reason.
Why I should be here again.
But then she blows out the candle.
And shows me the reason again.
Cause she loves like an angel.
She burns like an angel on fire.
On fire.
After the movie.
She walks in the park with a friend.
She tells it to her straight.
He don't mean nothing to me.
She says I can't believe him.
If I gave him enough rope he'd hang me.
But when she turns to him.
There's no place she'd rather be.
Cause she burns like an angel.
She burns like an angel on fire.
And she's stuck.
When she comes on so hot.
And you have never felt.
A heavenly slow burn.
I'm so hot.
When I leave her cold.
Frying in her room.
Like angels always do.
And you think I love you.
Just cause I said so.
Butterflies ""shiver"" (?).
She lives all the things that I've known.
She's thinking her diary.
Convincing her words as she goes.
She says heaven forgive me.
Am I going to pay for my sins?

988,1097,"Follow me into the desert.
As thirsty as you are.
Crack a smile and cut your mouth.
And drown in alcohol.
Cause down below the truth is lying.
Beneath the riverbed.
So quench yourself and drink the water.
That flows below her head.
Oh no, there she goes.
Out in the sunshine.
The sun is mine.
The sun is mine.
I shot my love today, would you cry for me.
I lost my head again, would you lie for me.
Close your eyes and bow your head.
I need a little sympathy.
Cause fear is strong and love's for everyone.
Who isn't me.
So kill your health and kill yourself.
And kill everything you love.
And if you live you can fall to pieces.
And suffer with my ghost.
I shot my love today, would you cry for me.
I lost my head again, would you lie for me.
I left her in the sand just a burden in my hand.
I lost my head again, would you cry for me.
It's just a burden in my hand.
It's just an anchor on my heart.
It's just a tumour in my head.
And I'm in the dark.
So follow me into the desert.
As desperate as you are.
Where the moon is glued to a picture of heaven.
And all the little pigs have God.
Oh no, there she goes.
Out in the sunshine.
The sun is mine.
The sun is mine.
I shot my love today, would you cry for me, yeah.
I lost my head again, would you lie for me.
I left her in the sand just a burden in my hand.
I lost my head again, would you cry for me.
Yeah, would you cry for me.
"
989,1099,"Whatsoever I feared.
Has come to life.
Whatsoever I've fought off.
Became my life.
Just when every day.
Seemed to greet me with a smile.
Sunspots have faded.
And now, I'm doing time.
Now, I'm doing time.
'Cause I fell on black days.
I fell on black days.
Whomsoever I've cured, I've sickened now.
Whomsoever I've cradled, I've put you down.
Search light soul, they say.
But I can't see it in the night.
I'm only faking.
When I get it right.
When I get it right.
'Cause I fell on black days.
I fell on black days.
How would I know.
That this could be my fate?
How would I know.
That this could be my fate?
Ooh yeah.
What you wanted to see good.
Has made you blind.
What you wanted to be yours.
Has made it mine.
Don't you lock up something.
That you wanted to see fly.
Hands are for shaking.
Not tying.
Not tying.
I sure don't mind a change, yeah.
I sure don't mind a change.
I sure don't mind a change.
I sure don't mind, sure don't mind a change.
Sure don't mind a change, ooo.
I sure don't mind a change.
'Cause I fell on black days.
I fell on black days, black days.
I fell on black days.
How would I know.
That this could be my fate?
I sure don't mind a change.
"
990,1100,"Shower in the dark day.
Clean sparks diving down.
Cool in the waterway.
Where the baptized drown.
Naked in the cold sun.
Breathing life like fire.
Thought I was the only one.
But that was just a lie.
'Cause I heard it in the wind.
And I saw it in the sky.
And I thought it was the end.
And I thought it was the 4th of July.
Yeah, yeah.
Pale in the flare light.
The scared light cracks and disappears.
Leads the scorched ones here.
And everywhere no one cares.
The fire is spreading.
And no one wants to speak about it.
Down in the hole.
Jesus tries to crack a smile.
Beneath another shovel load.
And I heard it in the wind.
And I saw it in the sky.
And I thought it was the end.
And I thought it was the 4th of July.
I heard it in the wind.
And I saw it in the sky.
And I thought it was the end.
And I thought it was the 4th of July (July, July, July).
Now I'm in control.
Now I'm in the fallout.
Once asleep, but now I stand.
And I still remember.
Your sweet everything.
Light a Roman candle.
Hold it in your hand.
And I heard it in the wind.
And I saw it in the sky.
And I thought it was the end.
And I thought it was the 4th of July.
I heard it in the wind.
And I saw it in the sky.
And I thought it was the end.
I thought it was the 4th of July.
